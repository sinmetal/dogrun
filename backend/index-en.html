                            Dominic Preuss, Robert Kubis who came in 2017, and Dan McGrath is also joining this year to do Fireside Chat with Room Owners. Spanner's Tokyo Region was released last year just during the Google Cloud Next Tokyo. This year we will talk about how Spanner should be used with everyone while users are already using Spanner in Japan. This year, Cloud Datastore will be upgraded to Cloud Firestore Datastore Mode. Topics around DB are inconsequential more then ever before!

In Google Cloud Next SF 18, Google Cloud announced that Cloud Function  added Python and Go support, and feature that allow users to Deploy a Container Image which can not be bound by Cloud Function runtime. Cloud Function has many Firebase event trigger and is a fully managed by Google Cloud, there is no need to manage the infrastructure by customer, so it is a useful product especially for Android, iOS and Web engineers. While using Kubernetes to build a rich infrastructure, there is also a great need for simple back-end applications to be completed within Google App Engine, Firebase, Cloud Functions and other serverless products. What kind of architecture should be taken in order to run the application without Ops? Let's see the world of Serverless togather.

BQML was announced in Google Cloud Next SF 18, and it became possible to do machine learning in BigQuery, and BigQuery GIS, a feature that will enable user to handle position information in BigQuery. BigQuery feature is targeted to all the human race, its use is expanding exponentially. Dataflow Shuffle Service has been added to Dataflow, Shuffle's performance has improved. Shuffle is also an important element for BigQuery, and it is used in JOIN, GROUP BY, etc. What kind of thought is made of Shuffle of BigQuery and Dataflow? What is the architecture to perform preprocessing for performing BQML with Dataflow? Interesting stories will be made for those who deal with the data, from small to large.

Machine learning became viral a few years ago, but the momentum did not wane and became common. However, it is still not as simple as anyone can use. How should we approaches to democratize data and utilize machine learning? This fireside chat will be for engineers who are suffering from the use of data, trying to figured out how to utilize Auto ML, or trying to lean 101 when starting deep reinforcement learning.
